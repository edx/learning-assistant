Purpose
*******

Plugin for a learning assistant backend, intended for use within edx-platform.

This library contains data models and logic for a platform wide learning assistant.

Dependencies
************
In addition to the edx-platform repository in which this library is installed, this plugin also
leverages the `frontend-lib-learning-assistant`_ as a frontend interface for the learning assistant.

Getting Started
***************

Developing
==========

One Time Setup
--------------
.. code-block::

  # Clone the repository (in the ../src relative to devstack repo)
  git clone git@github.com:openedx/learning-assistant.git
  cd learning-assistant

  # Set up a virtualenv with the same name as the repo and activate it
  # Here's how you might do that if you have virtualenvwrapper setup.
  mkvirtualenv -p python3.8 learning-assistant

In your ``requirements/edx/private.txt`` requirements file in edx-platform, add:

.. code-block::

  -e /edx/src/learning-assistant

In your ``lms/envs/private.py`` settings file in edx-platform (create file if necessary), add the below settings. The value of the API key shouldn't matter, because it's not being used at this point, but the setting needs to be there.

.. code-block::

  CHAT_COMPLETION_API = '' # copy url from edx-internal
  CHAT_COMPLETION_API_KEY = '' # add value though value itself does not matter

  LEARNING_ASSISTANT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = '' # copy value from edx-internal

  LEARNING_ASSISTANT_AVAILABLE = True

In devstack, run ``make lms-shell`` and run the following command: ``paver install_prereqs;exit``. This will install anything included in your ``private.txt`` requirements file.

In django admin, add the following waffle flag ``learning_assistant.enable_course_content`` and make sure it is turned on for Everyone. The flag should be checked on for: Superusers, Staff, and Authenticated.

This plugin depends on the lms and discovery - both should be running.
